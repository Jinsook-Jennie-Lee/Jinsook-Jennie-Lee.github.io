I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University under the guidance of [René F. Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Learning Lab](https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research sits at the intersection of education, data science, and computational social science. I am interested in AI evaluation in education systems especially in high-stakes decision-making processes. At Cornell, I have explored various topics related to college admissions, including: (1) analyzing how policy changes impact the allocation of educational opportunities; (2) investigating distinctive patterns in LLM-generated content such as homogenization, compared to human-authored college application essays; and (3) examining the uncertainty and arbitrariness of algorithmic predictions.

I'm also fortunate to collaborate with [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}.  

Prior to Cornell, I spent several years as a data scientist at Korea University to develop course and major recommender systems to support college students' decision making process.

I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — You'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category. I also love listening to music and curating songs!
