######I'm a Ph.D. student studying Information Science at Cornell University. My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, algorithmic fairness and  education, where I strive to support people in education through algorithmic decision-making process. I'm closely working with [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"}, [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I'm leading a project where we develop ML models for college admission systems and analyze algorithmic fairness. 

######Prior to Cornell, I contributed as a data scientist at Korea University to develope course and major recommendation systems for college students. Outside of work, I enjoy to play tennis, workout, and meditate.
