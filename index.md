I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University, under the guidance of [René F. Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Learning Lab](https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My passion lies at the intersection of education, data science/machine learning and algorithmic fairness. I focus on studying how to support high-stake decision making process with the computational methods especially in education settings. Currently, I'm leading a research project that applies ML/NLP to college application datasets and explores diverse topics - allocation biases under different policies, identity representation in college admission essays generated by human vs AI, etc. I'm also fortunate to collaborate with [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}.  

Prior to Cornell, I spent several years as a data scientist at Korea University to develope course and major recommender systems to support college students' decision making process. I received my MS in Fashion Marketing from Korea University and BAs in Education and Fashion Design & Merchandising from the same university.
 
Outside of work, I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — You'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category. I also love listening and curating music!
