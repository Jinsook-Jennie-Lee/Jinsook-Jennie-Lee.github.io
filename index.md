### I'm a Ph.D. student studying Information Science at Cornell University. My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, algorithmic fairness and  education, where I strive to support people in education through algorithmic decision-making process. I'm closely working with [Rene Kizilcec](/https://rene.kizilcec.com/), [Thorsten Joachims](/https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/), [Nikhil Garg](/https://gargnikhil.com/) and [AJ Alvero](/https://ajalvero.com/). I'm currently engaged in developing and analyzing ML models for college admissino systems while advocating for algorithmic fairness and equity. ### Prior to Cornell, I contributes as a data scientist at Korea University that I dedicated my efforts to developing course and major recommendation systems for college students.
