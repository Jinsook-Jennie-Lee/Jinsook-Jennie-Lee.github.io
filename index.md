Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University. My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, education and algorithmic fairness. I'm interested in how to support people's high-stake decision making processes, especially in education settings. Currently, I'm leading a research project that applies ML/NLP to college admission process and study algorithmic bias and fairness based on the prediction results. I'm grateful to work with [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"}, [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}.  

Prior to Cornell, I was a data scientist at Korea University to develop course and major recommendation systems for college students. I received my BA in Education, and Fashion Design & Merchandising from Korea University, MS in Fashion Marketing in the same institution. 

Outside of work, I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — As a member of the Cornell Korean Tennis Club, you'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category.
