Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University. My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning, education and algorithmic fairness to support people in education through algorithmic decision-making process. Currently, I'm leading a project that we develop ML models for college admission systems and analyze algorithmic fairness that I'm grateful to work with [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"}, [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm also working as a research assistant on the "LEVI Fairness and Transfer Learning Hub".  

Prior to Cornell, I contributed as a data scientist at Korea University to develop course and major recommendation systems for college students. I received my BA in Education, and Fashion Design & Merchandising from Korea University, MS in Fashion Marketing in the same institution. 

Outside of work, I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — As a member of the Cornell Korean Tennis Club, you'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category.
