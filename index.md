I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at Cornell University, under the guidance of [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Learning Lab](https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My passion lies at the intersection of education, data science/machine learning and algorithmic fairness. I focus on studying how to support high-stake decision making process with the computational methods especially in education settings. Currently, I'm leading a research project that applies ML/NLP to college application datasets and explores diverse topics - allocation biases under different policies, identity representation in college admission essays generated by human vs AI, etc. I'm also fortunate to collaborate with [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}, [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}.  

Prior to Cornell, I was a data scientist at Korea University to develop course and major recommendation systems for college students. I received my BA in Education, and Fashion Design & Merchandising from Korea University, MS in Fashion Marketing from the same institution. 

Outside of work, I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — As a member of the Cornell Korean Tennis Club, you'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category. I also love listening to music (64,681 minutes listened in 2023!)
