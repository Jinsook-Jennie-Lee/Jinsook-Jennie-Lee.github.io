I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at Cornell University advised by [René F. Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com){:target="_blank"} in the [Future of Learning Lab](https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj){:target="_blank"}. My research studies socio-technical systems in education through the lens of computational social science, focusing on how AI technologies influence evaluation, decision-making, and equity in high-stakes contexts. 

At Cornell, I study how language models influence college admissions both directly through applicants' use of LLMs in essay writing, and indirectly, through how institutions interpret and act on these AI-mediated signals. My recent work analyzes (1) how policy shifts and the rise of LLM-assisted writing reconfigure the allocation of educational opportunities; (2) how LLMs write differently in terms of lexical diversity, semantic space and stylistic homogenization in college essays; and (3) how uncertainty and arbitrariness manifest in algorithmic predictions within admissions.

Beyond admissions, I am also developing AI evaluation pipelines for tutoring data in collaboration with [National Tutoring Observatory](https://nationaltutoringobservatory.org){:target="_blank"} spanning multi-agent orchestration, and dialogue segmentation to enhance tutoring move annotation. 

I'm also fortunate to collaborate with [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com){:target="_blank"} and [AJ Alvero](https://ajalvero.com){:target="_blank"}.   

Prior to Cornell, I spent several years as a data scientist at Korea University to develop course and major recommender systems to support college students' decision making process.

I have a love-hate relationship with tennis — You'll often find me attempting to upgrade my skills from the ‘absolute beginner’ category. I also love listening to music and curating songs!
